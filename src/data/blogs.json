    "content": "# How to Check ATS Score for TCS NQT 2026\n\nLanding a job at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) through the National Qualifier Test (NQT) is a dream for thousands of engineering graduates in India. However, the first hurdle isn't the test itself—it's getting your resume past the TCS iON Applicant Tracking System (ATS). \n\n## Why TCS iON ATS is Different\n\nTCS uses a proprietary version of the iON platform to filter millions of applications. Unlike generic scanners, the TCS algorithm looks for specific institutional tags, CGPA stability, and a high density of core technical keywords like Java, Python, and SDLC.\n\n## Step-by-Step Optimization for TCS\n\n1. **Standardize Your Format:** Use a single-column layout. Avoid fancy graphics that the iON scanner might misinterpret as noise.\n2. **Keyword Injection:** Ensure your skills section matches the NQT job description exactly. If they ask for 'Agile', don't just write 'Scrum'.\n3. **Quantify Results:** TCS recruiters value scale. Instead of 'Worked on a project', write 'Developed a library management system serving 500+ daily users'.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: What is a good ATS score for TCS?**\n**A:** Aim for a score above 85 on PlacementScore.online to be in the top 5% of applicants.\n\n**Q: Does TCS reject resumes automatically?**\n**A:** Yes, resumes that fail to meet the basic keyword and formatting thresholds are often filtered out before the manual review stage."

If you make any of these critical errors, your chances of a callback are near zero.\n\n## 1. Using Incompatible Fonts\nATS scanners struggle with non-standard fonts. Stick to Arial, Calibri, or Georgia. Avoid custom 'Creative' fonts.\n\n## 2. Multi-Column Layouts\nScanners read top-to-bottom. Columns often cause the software to merge your experience with your education, creating a garbled mess.\n\n## 3. Missing Contact Information\nIf the bot can't find your phone number or email string, it can't move you to the 'Interview' stage.\n\n## 4. Lack of Metrics\n'Good at C++' means nothing. 'Optimized C++ algorithms to reduce execution time by 40%' means everything.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Can I use colors on my resume?**\n**A:** It's best to keep it professional. High contrast (Black on White) ensures the best OCR (Optical Character Recognition) performance."

Here is how they filter you out.\n\n## Phase 1: The Automated Filter\nBefore a human even opens your file, the ATS removes everyone below a certain score. This usually cuts 70% of the applicants.\n\n## Phase 2: The 6-Second Scan\nA junior recruiter looks at the remaining resumes. They look for college names, CGPA, and specific project impact. If they don't see numbers (e.g., 90% accuracy, 20% faster), they move on.\n\n## Phase 3: Technical Vetting\nSenior engineers review the finalists to see if the projects are real. This is where your 'Skills Gaps' on PlacementScore.online become critical to fix."
