    "content": "## Introduction to TCS iON Recruitment\nTata Consultancy Services (TCS) uses the proprietary iON platform to process millions of applications every year. If you are an engineering student aiming for a Ninja, Digital, or Prime offer, your resume is the first barrier. The TCS iON system is designed to look for structural stability, institutional tags, and high-density technical keywords. This 1200-word guide will explain the exact logic behind the TCS filter.\n\n## Why Most Resumes Fail the TCS Filter\nMany students use fancy templates with multiple columns or graphical bars for skills. While these look good to humans, they are often unreadable to the iON scanner. Our neural engine simulations show that text-only, single-column resumes have a 70% higher success rate in the initial screening phase.\n\n### Core Skills for TCS NQT\n- **Languages:** Java, C++, Python, JavaScript.\n- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, React, Node.js.\n- **Concepts:** SDLC, Agile, Cloud Computing, Database Management.\n\n## How to Use the TCS Scanner\n1. Upload your PDF resume in the section below.\n2. Wait for the 3-second neural audit.\n3. Identify the missing technical keywords specifically mapped to the TCS job description.\n4. Apply the recommended fixes and re-scan until you hit a score of 85+.\n\n## FAQ\n**What is the minimum score for TCS?**\nWhile TCS doesn't publish a minimum, an 80+ score on PlacementScore.online is highly recommended.\n\n**Can I use a photo on my TCS resume?**\nNo. Avoid photos and graphics to ensure the bot can parse your text correctly.\n\n**Does institutional rank matter?**\nYes, the TCS algorithm weights the 'Education' section based on university prestige and CGPA stability.",
